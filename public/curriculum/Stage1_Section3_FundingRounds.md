# Startup Fundraising: Key Concepts and Practical Implications

## Types of Investors
- **Angel investors**: Individuals investing their own money, often at early stages.
- **Venture capital (VC) firms**: Pools of outside capital for high-growth startups.
- **Institutional investors**: Large asset managers (e.g., Fidelity, T. Rowe Price) investing in growth-stage or pre-IPO startups.
- **Accelerators/incubators**: Programs offering mentorship and funding for equity.
- **Bootstrapping**: Using personal funds or revenue to build without outside investment.

## Types of Startup Funding
- **Convertibles**: Seed-stage financing often uses convertible securities (SAFEs, convertible notes) for speed and flexibility.
- **Priced rounds**: Equity investments at a negotiated valuation, usually preferred stock (Series A and beyond).
- **Down rounds**: Valuation lower than previous round; up rounds are higher.
- **Tranched financing**: Funds released as milestones are met.
- **Bridge rounds**: Extra money raised between priced rounds.
- **Venture debt**: Bank loans with less dilution.
- **Equity crowdfunding**: Small contributions from many investors via online platforms.

## Rounds of Funding
- **Pre-seed**: Bootstrapping, angels, friends/family, accelerators, pitch competitions, micro/pre-seed funds.
- **Seed**: Product demo, MVP, beta testing; investors include angels, VCs, crowdfunding, convertible securities.
- **Series A**: Institutional investors, preferred stock, formal valuation, term sheets.
- **Series B/C/D**: Growth-stage investors, larger checks, expansion, lower risk for investors.

## Fundraising Implications
- Each round dilutes founder/employee ownership.
- Investors may gain influence over company decisions (board seats, voting).
- Founders must balance raising enough capital for growth with maintaining ownership.
- Typical dilution: ~20% at seed, ~15.5% at Series A.

## How Much to Raise
- Raise enough for 24â€“30 months of runway (average time between rounds).
- Consider team, admin, marketing, and unexpected costs.
- Ideal valuation balances capital needs, investor satisfaction, and reasonable ownership.

## Preparing to Fundraise
- Define milestones and metrics.
- Gather data and build a compelling pitch deck.
- Target investors with relevant experience.
- Consult founders and attorneys for advice.

# Stage 2, Section 4: Exits & Cashing Out

## How Can You Cash Out?
You can cash out when the company is acquired, goes public, or allows a secondary sale of shares.

**Mechanics of Cashing Out:**
- **If you own shares:** When the company is acquired, you usually receive cash or shares in the acquiring company. The payment is based on the number of shares you own and the acquisition price per share. You may get a check, a wire transfer, or new shares.
- **If you have stock options:** You may need to "exercise" your options (buy shares at your option price) before the acquisition closes. This means you pay the exercise price to convert your options into shares, then those shares are bought by the acquiring company.
- **Choosing to exercise options:**
    - If your options are "in the money" (the acquisition price is higher than your option price), exercising makes sense.
    - If your options are "not in the money," you may not exercise, as you'd lose money.
    - Sometimes, companies allow a "net exercise" where the exercise cost is subtracted from your payout, so you don't need to pay cash upfront.
- **RSUs (Restricted Stock Units):** If you have RSUs, they may vest automatically at acquisition, and you receive cash or shares for them.
- **Options converted to buyer's options:** Sometimes, instead of cashing out, your options are converted into options in the acquiring company. In this case:
    - You do not need to exercise your options.
    - Your old options are replaced with new options in the buyer's company, usually at a new price and quantity based on the deal terms.
    - You continue to vest and exercise options under the new company's plan.
    - You may need to review and sign new option agreements, but you do not need to take action to receive the new options.
- **Taxes:** Cashing out can trigger taxes. You may owe income tax or capital gains tax depending on your situation.

**Example:**
- You have 1,000 options at $1 per share. The company is acquired for $10 per share.
- You exercise your options (pay $1,000), get 1,000 shares, and receive $10,000 from the acquisition. Your profit is $9,000 (minus taxes).
- If your options are converted, you might receive 500 options in the new company at a new price, and you do not need to pay anything now.

**Important:**
- You may need to act quicklyâ€”acquisitions have deadlines for exercising options.
- If you don't exercise in time, you may lose your options.
- If your options are converted, you usually do not need to do anything except review and accept the new terms.

## Types of Exits
- **Acquisition:** Company is bought by another.
- **IPO:** Company sells shares to the public.
- **Secondary Sale:** Selling shares before an exit event.

**IPO Details:**
- **Exercising Options Before IPO:**
    - If you have stock options, you usually need to exercise them before the IPO to receive actual shares.
    - Once exercised, your options become common shares in the company.
    - After the IPO, these common shares automatically convert into public shares that you can sell on the stock market (after the lockup period).
    - These are not RSUs. RSUs are a separate type of equity grant that vest over time and may also convert into public shares at IPO, but exercised options become common shares.
    - You now own public common shares, not RSUs or options.
- **Lockup Period:**
    - After the IPO, employees and early investors often have a "lockup period" (usually 6 months) during which they cannot sell their new public shares.
    - This is to prevent too many shares from flooding the market right after the IPO.
- **Cashing Out After IPO:**
    - Once the lockup period ends, you can sell your shares on the public market.
    - You may want to consult a financial advisor about timing and taxes.
- **Taxes:**
    - Selling shares after an IPO can trigger capital gains tax. The amount depends on how long you held the shares and your income level.

**Example:**
- You have 1,000 options at $2 per share. You exercise them before the IPO, paying $2,000.
- After the IPO, your shares are worth $20 each ($20,000 total).
- You must wait 6 months (lockup period) before you can sell your shares.
- After the lockup, you sell your shares and pay capital gains tax on the profit.

**Secondary Sale Details:**
- A secondary sale means selling your shares in a private company to another investor before an acquisition or IPO.
- There is no public market for private company shares, so secondary sales are usually arranged privately or through specialized platforms (like Carta, Forge, or EquityZen).
- The company must approve the sale, and there may be restrictions in your stock agreement.
- The price is negotiated between the seller and buyer, often based on the latest funding round price.

**Example:**
- You own 5,000 shares in a private startup. The company recently raised money at $10 per share.
- You find a buyer (another investor, or sometimes the company itself) willing to pay $10 per share.
- The company approves the sale, and you sell your shares for $50,000.
- You get cash now, instead of waiting for an acquisition or IPO.

**Important:**
- Not all companies allow secondary sales.
- You may need to pay taxes on any gains from the sale.
- Secondary sales can be a way for early employees or investors to get liquidity before a big exit event.

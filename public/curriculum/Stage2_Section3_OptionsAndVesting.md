# Stage 2, Section 3: Options & Vesting

---

## What Are Stock Options?
Stock options give you the right to buy shares at a set price. They are often used to reward employees. If you’re not sure what “shares” are, don’t worry—we’ll cover that in detail in the next section.

**Example:**
You join a startup and are granted 1,000 stock options at a price of $1 per share. If the company grows and the share price rises to $10, you can buy shares for $1 and sell for $10, making a profit of $9 per share.

---

## What Is Vesting?
Vesting means you earn your options over time. You can't use all your options right away.

**Example:**
You are granted 1,000 options with a 4-year vesting schedule and a 1-year cliff:
- After 1 year: 250 options vest (the cliff)
- After that: The remaining 750 options vest quarterly over the next 3 years (62.5 options per quarter)
- At 2 years: 250 + (4 x 62.5) = 500 options vested
- At 4 years: All 1,000 options vested

## In the Money vs. Not in the Money
If you see “in the money” or “not in the money,” it’s about whether your options are profitable. If you’re not sure what “option price” or “share price” means, don’t worry—we’ll explain those terms soon.

- **In the Money:** The share price is higher than your option price. For example, if your option price is $1 and the share price is $5, you can buy for $1 and sell for $5, making a profit.
- **Not in the Money:** The share price is lower than your option price. If your option price is $1 and the share price is $0.50, you would not exercise your options because you would lose money.

---

## What Is a Strike Price?
A strike price (or exercise price) is the fixed price you pay per share when you exercise your stock options. It’s set when your options are granted, usually at the fair market value (FMV) of the company’s stock on that date. If you’re not sure what FMV is, don’t worry—we’ll cover it in a future section.

---

## How Is Strike Price Determined?
- Public companies: FMV is the current market price.
- Private companies: FMV is set by a 409A valuation, a formal process to determine the value for tax purposes. (We’ll explain 409A in detail later.)
- Options are almost never priced below FMV.

---

## Option Value Over Time
- **At-the-money:** FMV = strike price.
- **In-the-money:** FMV > strike price (spread = profit).
- **Underwater:** FMV < strike price (not worth exercising).

**Example:**
- Strike price: $1, FMV: $5 → spread is $4 per share.
- Strike price: $1, FMV: $0.75 → options are underwater.

---

## Exercising Windows
You can exercise options after they vest, within the company’s exercise window (often 90 days after leaving). Consider taxes, affordability, and company outlook before exercising. If you’re not sure what “exercise” means, don’t worry—we’ll cover it in detail in the next section.

---

## What Does It Mean to Exercise Options?
Exercising stock options means purchasing shares at your strike price. You become a shareholder, but your money is tied up until you sell. The hope is that the shares appreciate in value, but there is risk they may not.

---

## How to Exercise
- **Cash Exercise (Exercise and Hold):** Use your own money to buy shares and hold them. Highest risk, but potential for greatest reward.
- **Cashless Exercise (Sell to Cover):** Exercise and sell enough shares to cover costs and taxes; keep the rest.
- **Cashless Exercise (Sell All):** Exercise and sell all shares in one transaction, pocketing the remainder after costs and taxes.

---

## When to Exercise
- You can only exercise vested options (unless your company allows early exercise).
- After leaving a company, you typically have a 90-day post-termination exercise window.
- Some companies offer longer windows.

---

## Early Exercise
Early exercise may allow for favorable tax treatment (ISOs: hold for 2 years after grant and 1 year after exercise). You must file an 83(b) election within 30 days of early exercise. If you’re not sure what an 83(b) election is, don’t worry—we’ll cover it in a future section.

---

## Should You Exercise?
Ask yourself:
1. Can you exercise (are options vested, is early exercise allowed)?
2. Are your options in the money or underwater?
3. How is the company performing?
4. Can you sell your shares after exercising (liquidity risk)?
5. Can you afford the taxes (AMT, ordinary income)?

---

## When to Sell Shares
- Sell immediately for guaranteed profit but higher taxes.
- Hold for at least a year for potential lower taxes and bigger profit (or loss).
- Sell within a year for highest tax rate.

**Tip:** Always consult a tax advisor before exercising or selling options.

## Mini-Game: Vesting Calendar
Test your understanding of vesting schedules!

**Scenario:**
You join a company and receive 1,000 options with a 4-year vesting schedule and a 1-year cliff.

**Question 1:** How many options will you have vested after 1 year?
- A) 0
- B) 250
- C) 500
- D) 1,000

**Correct Answer:** B) 250

**Question 2:** How many options will you have vested after 2 years?
- A) 250
- B) 500
- C) 750
- D) 1,000

**Correct Answer:** B) 500

**Question 3:** If you leave after 18 months, how many options do you keep?
- A) 250
- B) 375
- C) 500
- D) 1,000

**Correct Answer:** B) 375 (250 after 1 year + 2 quarters x 62.5 = 375)

## What Is a 409A Valuation?
A 409A valuation is an independent appraisal of a private company’s fair market value (FMV), used to set the strike price for stock options. It’s required by the IRS to ensure options are priced fairly and to avoid tax penalties. If you’re not sure what FMV is, don’t worry—we’ll cover it next.

---

## What Is Fair Market Value (FMV)?
FMV is the estimated price an asset (like company stock) would sell for in the current market under normal conditions. For public companies, FMV is the market price. For private companies, FMV is determined by a 409A valuation.

## Mini-Game: Startup Equity Calculator Challenge

### Scenario:
You’ve received a job offer from a startup. Use the information below to estimate the potential value of your equity grant.

#### Offer Details:
- Number of options: 10,000
- Strike price: $2.00
- Last preferred price: $5.00
- Post-money valuation: $100,000,000
- Total fully diluted shares: 20,000,000
- Hypothetical exit value: $500,000,000

### Questions:
1. What percentage of the company’s equity are you being offered?
2. What is the notional value of your option grant at the last preferred price?
3. If the company exits at $500M, what could your options be worth (before taxes and exercise costs)?
4. What is your total cost to exercise all your options?
5. If you negotiate and get 12,000 options instead, how does your potential value change?

### Instructions:
- Use the formulas below to calculate your answers:
  - Percent ownership = Number of options / Total fully diluted shares
  - Notional value = Number of options × Last preferred price
  - Potential exit value = (Hypothetical exit value × Percent ownership) - Total exercise cost
  - Total exercise cost = Number of options × Strike price

### Bonus Challenge:
- What questions should you ask the company to better understand your equity offer?
- How could refresh grants or employee liquidity events affect your outcome?

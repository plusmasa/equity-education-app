# Stage 2, Section 2: Shares & Dilution

---

## What Are Shares?
Shares represent ownership in a company. If you own shares, you own part of the company.

**Example:**
If a company has 100 shares and you own 10, you own 10% of the company.

## What Is Dilution?
Dilution happens when a company issues more shares. Each owner's percentage of the company gets smaller, but the company may become more valuable overall.

> If you see “dilution” mentioned in earlier sections, don’t worry—we’ll cover it in detail here.

**What does "issuing more shares" mean?**
- When a company wants to raise money, it creates new shares and sells them to new investors.
- These new shares did not exist before; the company "authorizes" them, increasing the total number of shares.
- The decision to issue more shares is made by the company's board of directors and approved by existing shareholders.
- The number of new shares is based on how much money the company wants to raise and the price investors are willing to pay.

**Detailed Example:**
Suppose you own 20 shares in a company with 100 total shares (20%).
- The company raises money and issues 100 new shares to investors. Now there are 200 shares total.
- You still own 20 shares, but now you own 10% of the company (20/200).

---

## Why Does Dilution Happen?
- When a company raises money, it often issues new shares to new investors.
- Existing shareholders own a smaller percentage, but the company uses the new money to grow.

---

## Does Dilution Always Hurt You?
Not necessarily! If the company uses the new money to grow and becomes much more valuable, your smaller percentage can be worth much more.

**Example:**
You own 10% of a company worth $100,000 ($10,000). After a funding round, you own 5% of a company worth $1,000,000 ($50,000). Your percentage shrank, but your shares are worth more.

---

## What About Multiple Rounds?
- Each time the company raises money, more shares are issued and your percentage shrinks further.
- If you don't invest in new rounds, you get diluted more.
- Sometimes, early investors can buy more shares to keep their percentage ("pro rata rights").

---

## Can You Ever Sell Your Shares?
- Usually, you must wait for an exit event (acquisition or IPO).
- Sometimes, you can sell in a secondary sale during later rounds.

## Mini-Game: Dilution Deep Dive

**Scenario 1:**
You own 50 shares in a company with 500 total shares (10%). The company issues 500 new shares in a Series A round.

**Question 1:** What is your new ownership percentage?
- A) 5%
- B) 10%
- C) 20%
- D) 50%

**Correct Answer:** A) 5% (50/1000)

**Scenario 2:**
You own 5% of a company worth $1,000,000. After a Series B round, you own 2.5% of a company worth $5,000,000.

**Question 2:** What is the value of your shares now?
- A) $25,000
- B) $50,000
- C) $125,000
- D) $250,000

**Correct Answer:** B) $125,000 (2.5% of $5,000,000)

**Scenario 3:**
You have pro rata rights and buy enough shares in a new round to keep your percentage at 10%. The company issues 100 new shares, and you buy 10 of them. What is your new percentage?
- A) 5%
- B) 10%
- C) 15%
- D) 20%

**Correct Answer:** B) 10%

**Scenario 4:**
You are an early investor. The company allows a secondary sale in Series C, and you sell half your shares. The company is later acquired. How does this affect your total payout?
- A) You get less from the acquisition, but you already received money from the secondary sale.
- B) You get the same as if you held all your shares.
- C) You get more from the acquisition.
- D) You lose all your money.

**Correct Answer:** A) You get less from the acquisition, but you already received money from the secondary sale.

## Interactive Mini-Game: Dilution Calculator

Try out a digital calculator to simulate a funding round and see how dilution works!

**Pre-filled Example Defaults:**
- Total shares before funding round: 1,000
- Your shares: 100
- Company valuation before funding round: $1,000,000
- Number of new shares issued: 500
- Price per new share: $2,000

You can change any of these numbers to see different outcomes.

**What you see:**
- Your new ownership percentage after new shares are issued
- Your new share value (based on new valuation)
- Total company shares after funding round
- Total company valuation after funding round

**How to play:**
1. Start with the example numbers above, or change them to your own.
2. Choose how many new shares to issue and the price per share.
3. See how your ownership percentage changes and how your share value changes.
4. Try different scenarios: Issue lots of shares at a high price, or fewer shares at a low price.

**Example Calculation:**
- Before: 1,000 total shares, you own 100 (10%), company worth $1,000,000 ($1,000/share)
- Issue: 500 new shares at $2,000/share ($1,000,000 raised)
- After: 1,500 total shares, you own 100 (6.67%), company worth $2,000,000
- Your shares now worth $2,000 each ($200,000 total)

**Key lesson:**
Dilution can shrink your percentage, but if the company raises money at a high price and grows, your shares can be worth much more!

## Common Stock vs. Preferred Stock: Key Differences and Implications

### Common Stock
- Represents basic ownership in the company.
- Typically issued to founders and early employees (often via restricted stock or stock options).
- Common stockholders usually have voting rights on company matters.
- Last in line for liquidation payouts—receive proceeds only after creditors and preferred stockholders are paid.
- Higher risk, but potential for significant upside if the company grows or is acquired at a high valuation.

### Preferred Stock
- Issued to investors (VCs, angels, private equity) during funding rounds.
- Comes with preferential rights and protections, including liquidation preference (paid out before common stockholders in an exit or bankruptcy).
- May have special voting privileges, conversion rights (can convert to common stock), and redemption/buyback provisions.
- Lower risk due to higher liquidation priority, but may have less upside than common stock in a big exit.

### Key Differences Table
| Feature                | Common Stock                        | Preferred Stock                       |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Ownership              | Basic equity ownership               | Ownership with preferential rights    |
| Recipients             | Founders, early employees           | Investors (funding rounds)            |
| Price                  | FMV, higher potential for gains      | Higher price, negotiated valuation    |
| Voting rights          | Usually yes                         | May have special privileges           |
| Convertibility         | No                                  | Often convertible to common           |
| Liquidity              | Illiquid, only at liquidity events   | Illiquid, may have redemption rights  |
| Liquidation payout     | Paid last                           | Paid first                            |
| Risk level             | Higher                              | Lower                                 |

### Practical Implications for Employees
- Employees usually receive common stock via options; investors get preferred stock.
- In a liquidity event, preferred stockholders are paid first, so common stockholders may only profit if the exit value is high enough.
- Understanding your stock type helps you assess risk and potential reward.

# Option Pools: Key Concepts and Practical Implications

## What Is an Option Pool?
- An option pool is a block of shares set aside by a company to issue equity to future employees, advisors, consultants, or contractors.
- The pool can be used for stock options, RSUs, or other equity grants.

## Why Option Pools Matter
- Equity compensation helps attract and retain talent without increasing cash burn rate.
- Venture capital investors expect startups to have option pools for employee equity.
- Option pools are part of the cap table and help plan hiring and future equity grants.

## How Option Pools Work
- Option grants must be formally approved by the board and require an up-to-date 409A valuation to set the strike price and FMV.
- The option pool size is typically increased at each fundraising round to accommodate new hires and refresh grants.
- Two sizing strategies:
  - Bottoms-up: Build pool based on hiring plan and equity benchmarks for each role.
  - Top-down: Use industry benchmarks (often 10% of company shares, but varies).

## Option Pools and Dilution
- Creating or expanding an option pool dilutes existing shareholders, including founders.
- Example: Founder owns 10,000 shares (100%). Creating a 1,500-share option pool means founder now owns 87% (10,000/11,500).
- Investors may negotiate option pool size in term sheets; larger pools can mean more dilution for founders.

## Managing Your Option Pool
- Forecast equity needs for new hires and refresh grants.
- Use cap table and equity benchmarking data to model pool size and impact on dilution.
- Adjust pool size as company grows and hires more employees.

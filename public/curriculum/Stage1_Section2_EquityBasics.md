# Equity: Key Concepts and Practical Implications

## Stage 1, Section 2: Equity Basics

---

## What Is Equity?
- Equity is an ownership stake in a company, held by founders, employees, investors, advisors, and consultants.
- In public companies, equity is transparent and available to anyone; in private companies, equity is typically reserved for employees and accredited investors.

If you see terms like “shares,” “stock options,” or “RSUs” in later sections, don’t worry—we’ll introduce each concept step by step.

## Types of Equity
- Common shares: Issued to founders and employees, usually with voting rights and potential for upside, but lower liquidation preference.
- Preferred shares: Issued to investors, with preferential rights and liquidation priority.
- Membership interests (LLCs): Ownership units with financial and voting privileges.
- Profits interests (LLCs): Share in future profits or growth.
- Phantom equity: Cash payout based on company milestones, not actual ownership.

## Equity Compensation
- Stock options (ISOs, NSOs): Right to buy shares at a fixed price; ISOs may have favorable tax treatment.
- RSUs: Promise to grant shares or cash if conditions are met; taxed at vesting.
- RSAs: Shares granted up front, subject to vesting; common at early-stage companies.

## Why Companies Offer Equity
- Aligns interests of employees and company.
- Attracts and retains talent, especially when cash is tight.
- Offers potential for wealth creation if company succeeds.

---

## Vesting
Most equity awards vest over time or upon meeting milestones. If you’re not sure what “vesting” means, don’t worry—we’ll cover it in detail in Stage 2.

---

## Liquidity
- Equity becomes valuable when it can be sold (liquidity event: IPO, acquisition, secondary transaction).
- Public company equity is liquid; private company equity is illiquid until a liquidity event.

---

## Calculating Equity Value
Value depends on number of shares/options, strike price, FMV, and company valuation. We’ll cover FMV and strike price in later sections.

## The Ownership Economy
- Equity gives employees a personal stake in company success, aligning incentives and fostering long-term commitment.

# Restricted Stock Units (RSUs): Key Concepts and Practical Implications

## What Are RSUs?
- RSUs are a form of equity compensation—a promise to grant shares (or cash equivalent) in the future if certain conditions are met.
- Unlike stock options, you don’t pay to receive RSUs; you only pay taxes when shares are delivered.
- RSUs are more common at larger, later-stage companies.

## How RSUs Work
- Vesting conditions: Can be time-based, milestone-based (e.g., IPO, acquisition), or a combination.
- Settlement: RSUs convert to shares upon vesting and settlement. Sometimes settlement is delayed for administrative reasons.
- Single-trigger RSUs: Only one vesting condition (usually time).
- Double-trigger RSUs: Two conditions (usually time + liquidity event); you must be employed at the time of the event to receive shares.

## Taxation
- RSUs are taxed as ordinary income at settlement, based on the FMV of shares received.
- Employers withhold 22% federal tax on the first $1M, 37% above $1M; you may owe more depending on your tax rate.
- You also owe Social Security, Medicare, and state taxes.
- "Sell-to-cover" allows you to sell some shares to cover taxes.
- If you sell shares after vesting, you may owe capital gains tax on any appreciation (short-term if held <1 year, long-term if held >1 year).

## Liquidity
- Public company RSUs: Can usually sell shares after vesting, subject to trading policies.
- Private company RSUs: Must wait for a liquidity event (IPO, acquisition, tender offer) or company approval for private sale.

## What Happens When You Leave
- You keep fully vested shares; unvested RSUs are forfeited.
- For double-trigger RSUs, you may lose unvested shares if you leave before the liquidity event.

## RSUs vs. Stock Options
- RSUs: No purchase required, taxed at vesting, less upside but less risk.
- Options: Must pay to exercise, taxed at exercise/sale, more upside but more risk.

# Stage 3, Section 2: Capital Gains & Taxes

## What are Capital Gains?
Capital gains are the profit you make when you sell an asset for more than you paid for it.

**Example:**
You buy 10 shares at $10 each ($100 total). You sell them for $15 each ($150 total). Your capital gain is $50.

## Short-Term vs. Long-Term
- **Short-Term Capital Gains (STCG):**
    - Gains from selling assets held for one year or less.
    - Taxed at your ordinary income tax rate (same as your salary or wages).
    - This rate can be much higher than the long-term rate, depending on your income.
- **Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG):**
    - Gains from selling assets held for more than one year.
    - Taxed at special lower rates: 0%, 15%, or 20%, depending on your income level.
    - Most people pay 15%, but high earners pay 20%, and some pay 0% if their income is low.

**Example:**
- You sell stock after 6 months for a $1,000 gain. If your income tax rate is 32%, you pay $320 in taxes (STCG).
- You sell stock after 2 years for a $1,000 gain. If your LTCG rate is 15%, you pay $150 in taxes.

**Why does this matter?**
- Holding assets for more than a year can save you a lot in taxes.
- STCG can be taxed at rates as high as 37% (top income bracket), while LTCG is capped at 20% for high earners.

## How Are Capital Gains Taxed?
You pay taxes based on how long you owned the asset and your income level.

**Example:**
If your long-term capital gains tax rate is 15% and you made $1,000 in gains, you pay $150 in taxes.

# Stage 3, Section 1: RSUs & Stock Grants

## What are RSUs?
RSU stands for Restricted Stock Unit. Companies give RSUs to employees as part of their pay. You get the shares after meeting certain conditions (like staying at the company for a set time).

**Details and Examples:**
- RSUs are "restricted" because you do not own the shares until they vest (after you meet the required time or performance conditions).
- Once RSUs vest, you receive actual shares in the company.
- If the company is public, these shares are public shares, but they may still be subject to a lockup period (for example, after an IPO or major grant).
- Lockup periods for RSUs can prevent you from selling your shares for a set time (often 6 months after IPO or grant).
- During the lockup, you own the shares but cannot sell them.
- After the lockup, you can sell your shares on the public market.

**How are RSUs different from normal public shares?**
- RSUs are granted to you but are not yours until they vest.
- Public shares are already owned and can be bought or sold at any time (unless restricted by a lockup).
- RSUs may have additional restrictions, such as forfeiture if you leave the company before vesting.
- Once RSUs vest and any lockup ends, they become normal public shares.

**Example:**
- You are granted 400 RSUs that vest over 4 years (100 per year).
- After 1 year, 100 RSUs vest and you receive 100 shares.
- The company goes public, and you must wait 6 months (lockup) before selling your shares.
- After the lockup, you sell your 100 shares at $25 each for $2,500.

## RSUs vs. Stock Options
- **RSUs:** You get shares for free after vesting.
- **Stock Options:** You buy shares at a set price.

**Example:**
If you have 100 RSUs and the share price is $30, you get $3,000 worth of shares. If you have 100 stock options at $10 and the share price is $30, you pay $1,000 to buy the shares and can sell for $3,000, making a $2,000 profit.

## Taxes on RSUs
You pay taxes when RSUs vest and you receive the shares.

**Why do you pay taxes when RSUs vest?**
- When RSUs vest, you receive shares as income. The value of the shares at the time they vest is considered ordinary income by the IRS (or your local tax authority).
- You pay income tax on the value of the shares when they are granted to you (at vesting), even if you do not sell them right away.
- This is different from buying stock, where you only pay capital gains tax when you sell the shares for a profit.

**How is this different from normal stock?**
- If you buy stock with your own money, you do not pay taxes until you sell it for a profit (capital gains tax).
- With RSUs, you did not buy the sharesâ€”they were granted to you as compensation, so they are taxed as income when you receive them.
- Later, if you sell the shares for more than their value at vesting, you pay capital gains tax on the additional profit.

**Example:**
- You receive 100 RSUs that vest when the share price is $20. You pay income tax on $2,000 (100 x $20) when they vest.
- If you sell the shares later for $25 each, you pay capital gains tax on the $500 profit ($2,500 - $2,000).

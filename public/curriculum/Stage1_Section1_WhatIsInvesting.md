# Stage 1, Section 1: What is Investing?

## What is Investing?
Investing means putting your money into something with the hope that it will grow over time. You can invest in things like stocks, bonds, real estate, or even your own business.

**Example:**
If you put $100 in a savings account with 2% interest, after one year you’ll have $102. If you invest $100 in stocks and they grow by 10%, you’ll have $110 after one year. But stocks can also lose value, so you might end up with less than $100.

## Why Do People Invest?
People invest to grow their wealth, save for the future, and reach financial goals like buying a house or retiring comfortably.

**Example:**
If you invest $5,000 every year for 20 years and earn an average return of 7% per year, you could have over $200,000 by the end, thanks to compounding.

## Key Concepts
- **Assets:** Things you own that have value (like stocks, cash, or property).
- **Risk vs. Reward:** Higher rewards often come with higher risks. Safer investments usually grow slower.
- **Compounding:** Earning money on both your original investment and the money it has already earned.

**Example:**
If you earn 5% on $100, you get $5. Next year, you earn 5% on $105, which is $5.25. Over time, this adds up!

**Timeline Example:**
Let's say you invest $1,000 and earn 7% per year:
- Year 1: $1,070
- Year 2: $1,144.90
- Year 3: $1,225.04
- Year 4: $1,310.79
- Year 5: $1,402.55
- Year 10: $1,967.15
- Year 20: $3,869.68

You started with $1,000. After 20 years, you have $3,869.68. You earned an extra $2,869.68 just for doing nothing—your money worked for you!

If you started with $5,000, after 20 years at 7% per year, you would have $19,348.41. That's an extra $14,348.41 earned passively!

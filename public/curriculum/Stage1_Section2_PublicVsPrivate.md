# Stage 1, Section 2: Public vs. Private Companies

## What is a Public Company?
A public company is one whose shares are traded on a stock exchange. Anyone can buy or sell shares.

**Example:**
Apple, Google, and Coca-Cola are public companies. You can buy their shares on the stock market and sell them any time the market is open.

## What is a Private Company?
A private company is owned by a small group of people. Shares are not traded on public exchanges.

**Example:**
SpaceX and Stripe are private companies. Only certain investors or employees can own shares.

## Key Differences
- **Liquidity:** Public company shares are easier to buy and sell. Private company shares are very hard to sell.
- **Transparency:** Public companies must share financial information. Private companies do not have to.
- **Ownership:** Private companies often have fewer owners.

**Selling Private Company Shares:**
If you own shares in a private company, you usually cannot sell them whenever you want. The only ways to cash out are:
- If the company is acquired (bought by another company)
- If the company goes public (IPO)
- If the company allows a secondary sale (special permission to sell your shares to someone else)

Most private company investors must wait for one of these events to get their money out. Sometimes, you may own shares for many years before you can sell them.

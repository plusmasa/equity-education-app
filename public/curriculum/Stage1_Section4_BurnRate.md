# Burn Rate: Key Concepts and Practical Implications

## What Is Burn Rate?
- Burn rate is the rate at which a company spends its cash reserves before reaching profitability.
- It is used to measure financial sustainability and determine how long a company can operate before needing more funding.
- The burn rate is calculated monthly and there are two types:
  - Gross burn rate: This is the total monthly cash outflow, considering expenses only.
  - Net burn rate: This is the gross burn rate minus the monthly revenue.

## Example Calculation
- For instance, if a company spends $100,000 per month and earns $30,000 per month, the net burn rate would be $70,000.
- Therefore, with $700,000 in the bank, the runway would be 10 months, calculated as $700,000 divided by $70,000.

## Why Burn Rate Matters
- Understanding the burn rate shows how much it costs to run the company and how long the current cash will last.
- It aids in planning for future fundraising and managing spending.
- Investors often use the burn rate to assess a company's financial health and valuation.

## Fixed vs. Variable Expenses
|   | Fixed costs (overhead)         | Variable costs                |
|---|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
|**Definition**| Costs that stay the same each month | Costs that fluctuate monthly |
|**Examples**  | Salaries, rent, subscriptions      | Marketing, inventory, contractors |

## Managing Burn Rate
- It is crucial to track both fixed and variable expenses.
- Regular reviews of spending can help identify areas to cut back or adjust.
- There should be a balance between aggressive growth (which requires a higher burn) and sustainability (which requires a lower burn).
- Utilizing accounting systems to monitor cash flow, income statements, and runway is recommended.

## Practical Tips
- Companies should aim to raise enough funds for 24â€“30 months of runway.
- Knowing the monthly burn rate is essential for making informed decisions about hiring, marketing, and product development.
- The burn rate should be adjusted as needed to hit milestones and avoid running out of cash.

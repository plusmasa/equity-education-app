# Stage 2, Section 1: Startup Lifecycle

## How Do Startups Grow?
Startups usually begin with an idea and a small team. They raise money in stages to grow their business.

**Example:**
A startup might raise $100,000 from friends and family (seed round), then $2 million from investors (Series A), and later $10 million (Series B) as it grows.

## Why Raise More Funding?
Even if a company is profitable after the seed round, it might want to raise more money to:
- Hire more employees
- Build new products or features
- Expand into new markets
- Invest in marketing and sales
- Outpace competitors

**Example:**
A startup making $50,000 profit per year could use Series A funding to hire a sales team, launch in new cities, or develop new technology. This could help the company grow much faster than relying only on profits.

## What Happens When You Raise Funds?
Raising funds means selling shares (ownership) in the company to new investors. This gives away part of the company, so founders and early investors own less.

**Effect on Founders:**
- Founders' ownership percentage goes down (dilution)
- But, if the company grows, their smaller piece can be worth much more
- Founders may lose some control if they give away too much ownership

**Example:**
If a founder owns 60% after seed, but raises Series A and Series B, they might end up with 30%. If the company is worth $10 million, their 30% is $3 millionâ€”much more than their original 60% of a smaller company.

## Funding Rounds Explained

### Seed Round
- **Who invests?** Friends, family, angel investors, and sometimes early-stage venture capital funds.
- **What do they get?** Shares or convertible notes (which can turn into shares later).
- **Upside:** If the company succeeds, early investors can see huge returns (sometimes 100x or more).
- **Risk:** Most startups fail, so seed investors can lose all their money.
- **Dilution:** As the company raises more money, seed investors' ownership percentage can shrink unless they invest more.

### Moving to Series A
- **When?** After the startup shows some traction (users, revenue, product-market fit).
- **Who invests?** Venture capital firms.
- **What happens?** The company raises a larger amount (e.g., $2 million) to grow faster.
- **Upside:** Series A investors get shares at a lower price than later rounds, so they have good upside if the company grows.
- **Risk:** Still high risk, but the company is less likely to fail than at seed stage.
- **Seed Investors:** Their shares are diluted, but they still own a piece of the company. If the company succeeds, their shares can be very valuable.

### Series B and Beyond
- **Who invests?** Larger venture capital firms, sometimes growth equity funds.
- **What happens?** The company raises even more money (e.g., $10 million) to scale up.
- **Upside:** Series B investors get shares at a higher price, so their upside is lower than earlier investors, but still significant.
- **Risk:** The company is more established, so risk is lower, but not zero.
- **Seed and Series A Investors:** Their ownership is diluted further, but their shares are worth more if the company is growing.

### Dilution
- Every time new shares are issued in a funding round, existing investors own a smaller percentage of the company. However, if the company grows, their smaller piece can be worth much more.

### Can Early Investors Exit?
- Usually, early investors cannot sell their shares until an exit event (acquisition or IPO).
- Sometimes, in later rounds, the company allows some early investors to sell a portion of their shares in a "secondary sale."

## Mini-Game: Funding Round Journey

**Scenario:**
You invest $10,000 in a startup at the seed round and get 10% of the company. The company raises Series A and issues new shares, so your ownership drops to 5%. At Series B, your ownership drops to 2.5%. The company is acquired for $10 million.

**Question 1:** How much do you get from the acquisition?
- A) $10,000
- B) $250,000
- C) $500,000
- D) $1,000,000

**Correct Answer:** B) $250,000 (2.5% of $10 million)

**Question 2:** If you were allowed to sell half your shares in a secondary sale at Series B for $200,000, how much do you get in total after the acquisition?
- A) $250,000
- B) $350,000
- C) $450,000
- D) $500,000

**Correct Answer:** B) $350,000 ($200,000 from secondary sale + $150,000 from acquisition for remaining shares)

**Scenario 2:**
You are a founder with 60% ownership after the seed round. After Series A and B, your ownership drops to 30%. The company is now worth $20 million.

**Question 3:** What is your stake worth?
- A) $6 million
- B) $12 million
- C) $20 million
- D) $3 million

**Correct Answer:** A) $6 million (30% of $20 million)

**Scenario 3:**
You are a Series A investor with 15% ownership. The company raises Series B and your ownership drops to 10%. The company is acquired for $50 million.

**Question 4:** How much do you receive?
- A) $5 million
- B) $7.5 million
- C) $10 million
- D) $15 million

**Correct Answer:** C) $5 million (10% of $50 million)

**Scenario 4:**
You are a seed investor. The company allows a secondary sale at Series B, and you sell all your shares for $100,000. The company is later acquired for $1 million. How much do you receive from the acquisition?
- A) $0
- B) $100,000
- C) $1 million
- D) $10,000

**Correct Answer:** A) $0 (you already sold your shares in the secondary sale)

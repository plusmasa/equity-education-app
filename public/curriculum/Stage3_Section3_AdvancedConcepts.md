# Stage 3, Section 3: Advanced Concepts

## ESPP (Employee Stock Purchase Plan)
Lets employees buy company stock at a discount.

**Details and Examples:**
- ESPP allows you to buy company stock at a discount, usually 10-15% below market price.
- When you buy stock at a discount and sell it right away, the discount is taxed as ordinary income (STCG).
- If you hold the stock for more than a year, any additional gain is taxed as LTCG.

**Example 1 (10% Discount):**
- Stock price: $100
- ESPP price: $90 (10% discount)
- You buy and sell immediately: $10 gain per share, taxed as income (STCG)
- If your income tax rate is 24%, you keep $7.60 per share ($10 - $2.40 tax)
- If the stock drops, you could lose money after taxes and fees
- A 10% discount may not be worth it after taxes and risk

**Example 2 (15% Discount):**
- Stock price: $100
- ESPP price: $85 (15% discount)
- You buy and sell immediately: $15 gain per share, taxed as income (STCG)
- If your income tax rate is 24%, you keep $11.40 per share ($15 - $3.60 tax)
- More cushion against taxes and price drops

**Example 3 (20% Discount):**
- Stock price: $100
- ESPP price: $80 (20% discount)
- You buy and sell immediately: $20 gain per share, taxed as income (STCG)
- If your income tax rate is 24%, you keep $15.20 per share ($20 - $4.80 tax)
- A 20% discount is usually worth it, even after taxes

**Key Point:**
- The higher the discount, the more likely ESPP is worth it, even after taxes
- If the discount is low, taxes and risk can wipe out your gains

## 10b5-1 Plans
A plan to sell company stock at set times, even during blackout periods.

**Details and Examples:**
- A 10b5-1 plan is a legal agreement that lets insiders (like executives and employees) sell company stock on a set schedule, even if they know material nonpublic information.
- You set up the plan when you do NOT have inside information, and it specifies when and how much stock will be sold in the future.
- The plan is approved by the company and broker, and is filed with regulators.

**Why do people use 10b5-1 plans?**
- To avoid accusations of insider trading
- To create a predictable schedule for selling shares
- To diversify holdings and manage risk

**Who's involved?**
- The employee or executive
- The company's legal and compliance team
- The broker who executes the trades

**Positives:**
- Allows sales during blackout periods (when trading is normally restricted)
- Provides legal protection against insider trading claims
- Helps with financial planning

**Negatives:**
- Once set, the plan is hard to change or cancel
- You may have to sell shares at a bad time (if the price drops)
- The plan must be set up when you do NOT have inside information

**Tax Consequences:**
- Selling shares under a 10b5-1 plan is taxed the same as any other sale (STCG or LTCG depending on holding period)
- No special tax treatment

**Real Life Example:**
- A CEO sets up a 10b5-1 plan to sell 1,000 shares every quarter for the next 2 years.
- Even if the CEO learns about a big upcoming deal, the sales go through as scheduled.
- The CEO avoids insider trading accusations and can plan finances.
- If the stock price drops, the CEO still sells as planned, which can be a downside.

**Why sell stock on a regular cadence?**
- **Cashflow:** Regular sales provide steady income, which can help pay for expenses, fund retirement, or make large purchases.
- **Diversification:** Selling company stock over time lets you invest in other assets (like index funds, real estate, or bonds) and reduces risk if your company stock drops in value.
- **Risk Management:** If most of your wealth is in company stock, selling regularly helps protect you from big losses if the company faces trouble.
- **Financial Planning:** Scheduled sales make it easier to plan for taxes, investments, and spending.
- **Mindset:** People who use 10b5-1 plans often want to avoid "betting everything" on their company. They prefer a balanced portfolio and predictable finances.
- **Why not just hold?** Holding all your company stock is risky—if the company fails or the stock price drops, you could lose a lot. Diversifying by selling some shares is a safer long-term strategy.

**Example Mindset:**
- "I want to make sure my family's future is secure, even if my company stock goes down. By selling a little at a time, I can invest in other things and sleep better at night."

**Risks of a 10b5-1 Plan:**
- If the company has bad quarters or years of flat/down performance, the stock price may drop, and you could end up selling shares at a much lower price than expected.
- Because the plan is set in advance, you cannot change your sales to avoid selling at a low price.
- If the stock price falls for a long time, you may miss out on higher prices later, or sell most of your shares at a loss.
- If you sell too few shares, you remain exposed to company risk; if you sell too many, you may miss out on future gains if the company recovers.

**How to minimize downside risk:**
- Consider selling a consistent percentage of your holdings over time (e.g., 5% per quarter), rather than a fixed number of shares. This way, you sell fewer shares when the price is low and more when the price is high.
- Diversify your portfolio by investing proceeds in other assets, so you are less affected by your company’s performance.
- Review your plan with a financial advisor to balance risk and reward based on your goals and risk tolerance.

**Example:**
- If you sell 100 shares every quarter and the stock price drops from $100 to $50, your quarterly proceeds drop from $10,000 to $5,000.
- If you sell a percentage (e.g., 5% of your holdings), you automatically sell fewer shares when the price is low, helping preserve your remaining shares for a possible recovery.

## Blackout Periods
Times when employees can't sell company stock (often around earnings reports).

**More Details:**
- Blackout periods are set by companies to prevent employees from trading stock when they might have access to material nonpublic information.
- Common reasons for blackout periods:
    - Before and after quarterly earnings announcements
    - When a major deal (like an acquisition or merger) is being negotiated
    - When new products or financial results are about to be released
    - During major company events (e.g., IPO, restructuring)
- Blackout periods help prevent insider trading and protect the company’s reputation.

**How do employees know when they can and can't sell?**
- Companies notify employees about blackout periods via email, internal portals, or HR communications.
- Employees are told the start and end dates of each blackout period.
- Some companies have regular scheduled blackout periods (e.g., every quarter around earnings).
- Employees can check with their legal or compliance team if they are unsure.
- Trading during a blackout period can result in penalties or disciplinary action.
